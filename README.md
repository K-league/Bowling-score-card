# Bowling Card

As a Bowler I want to be able to enter a list of bowling frame scores so that I can see the prgress and total score of my game.

## Getting Started
In order to play with this app you need to clone the repo as shown below
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/K-league/Bowling-score-card.git
```

In the project directory run:

### `npm start`

This command runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

# Explination

This exercise is not complete. Originally this application was an HTML page with much repetitive code and not much logic. In its second iteration, the HTML was dryer. In the third iteration, the application utilizes ReactJS, which nearly eliminated all repetitive code, thus leaving it less prone to error. The code is dryer. There is logic; however, it is not functional.

While intended to be whole upon submission, this application, in its current non-functional state, is far from the HTML file that started this journey. This application has many valuable lessons to teach, all of which I intend to learn. Thank you very much for your consideration of this submission. Constructive feedback is most welcome.
